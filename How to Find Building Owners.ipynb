    "# Finding Building Owners\n",
    "\n",
    "Research question: who owns the largest buildings in Seattle? How much pollution are those buildings responsible for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Research challenge: We have a dataset of large buildings (>20k sq ft) and their carbon footprint from the [City of Seattle's Office of Sustainability and the Environment](https://www.seattle.gov/environment/climate-change/buildings-and-energy/energy-benchmarking). This means that we can group those buildings by owner and determine the carbon footprint of each owner. However,the City of Seattle does not provide us with the owners of buildings in the carbon benchmarking dataset. Without this data, we can't determine which companies have the largest environmental impact on Seattle. Moreover, the companies listed as building owners in the King County property database are often shell companies. There is no database where you can look up the parent company for a shell company. There is also no reliable way to find a parent company's shell companies (though this assumes you're looking for buildings owned by one particular company).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of the report, we focused our search on buildings in the downtown neighborhood that are over 100 sq. ft. We decided this for political reasons but also because downtown is where a significant portion of the largest buildings in Seattle are located, and larger buildings seemed to on average have higher carbon emissions intensities. The benefit of extensible code is that we can change our minds at any time and select a different subset of the data (perhaps we want to consider a particular council district) and have results within a few minutes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vocabulary used in this tutorial**\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Corporations and Charities Filings System](https://www.sos.wa.gov/corporations-charities): a publicly-available government database listing all companies and non-profits in Washington State.\n",
    "- [eRealProperty](https://blue.kingcounty.com/Assessor/eRealProperty/default.aspx): a publicly-available government database that lists the owners of all real estate parcels in King County (where Seattle is located).\n",
    "- Parent company: a company that owns subsidiary companies.\n",
    "- Principal: a person who is an officer or director of a company. A company must list at least one principal to be incorporated.\n",
    "- Shell company: a company owned by a parent company that disguises its relationship with that parent company. Creating a different shell company for every building owned by a parent company is a common tactic to hide the extent of a company's real estate holdings.\n",
    "- Tax parcel owner: the result of looking up an address in eRealProperty. Also referred to as the building owner in this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finding a building's owner is then a three-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Get a list of buildings that you want to determine ownership for. In our use case, we are looking at buildings listed in Seattle's Office of Sustainability's (OSE) building emissions reports. \n",
    "1. Find the parcel owner for the lot the building is on, using the eRealProperty website. \n",
    "2. Given the parcel owner from Step 1, search the Washington State Corporations and Charities Filings database for that company and collect the company's principals.\n",
    "3. Search the company principals on Google and see what company they work for based on Linkedin, business journal articles, etc. Whichever company they all work for (or worked for most recently) is the parent company that owns the building.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note on methodology: parent companies re-use the same people as principals for their shell companies again and again. The principals also tend to stay with a company for a long time. This is why searching for the current or most recent employer for each of the principals will get you the parent company in most cases. Where this doesn't work, some digging and a bit of common sense (when was the company incorporated? Where were these people working at that time, according to Linkedin?) will get you the rest of the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps 1 and 2 are done programmatically. Step 3 is done by hand. The steps are outlined below."

    "# Step 0: Clean up Seattle OSE Data and Identify Buildings of Interest\n",
    "Seattle's [Office of Sustainability and Environment](https://www.seattle.gov/environment) has released emissions data for buildings in the city from 2015 to 2021. Building owners over 20,000 sq.ft. are required to self-report annually to the city of Seattle. Features of the data include:\n",
    "- building name\n",
    "- address\n",
    "- tax parcel identification number\n",
    "- council district the building is located within\n",
    "- buliding type\n",
    "- different metrics for emissions. \n",
    "More metadata about the energy benchmarking datasets can be found [here](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/2021-Building-Energy-Benchmarking/bfsh-nrm6).\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing initial exploratory analysis, we noticed that not all of the council district codes were correct. To rectify this we got the official council district boundaries form [Seattle GeoData Portal](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/seattle-city-council-districts-for-council-members-serving-through-2023/explore) in the form of a geojson file [`Council_Districts.geojson`](../../../data/Council_Districts.geojson). For each address in the OSE building efficiency dataset, we convert it to a (latitude, longitude) point and confirmed with which council distirct it belonged to.

    "To use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantiate an instance of the `ParcelLookupHelper` class, including the file path where you want to save your results.\n",
    "2. Run the `scrape_parcel_owners` method. Params:\n",
    "    - `tax_parcel_id_numbers` (list): a list of the tax parcel IDs you want to look up\n",
    "    - `file_name` (str): the file name to save the results\n",
    "    - `get_unit_details` (bool): whether or not to create a JSON file of the types of units in each building. Defaults to `False`. \n",

    "- eRealProperty restricts you to 1,000 calls a day from a given IP address. You can divide your buildings into chunks of 1,000 and do this over several days or divide them between team members. Using different AWS or Google Cloud instances is possible but probably a bit rude. You could also use a VPN for similar results. Either way, you'll have to manually chunk this up into calls of 1,000 at least.\n"

    "### Step 2.1: Map Parcel Owner Names to Businesses in the CCF Database\n",
    "The CCFS database's search engine tends to return almost any partial string match, which is overwhelming, but we can programmatically look up a business name and with some regex string matching magic, we can usually find the equivalent business in the CCFS database. For example, the tax parcel owner `ACORN DEVELOPMENT LLC` might show up in the CCFS database as `ACORN DEVELOPMENT L.L.C.`. The CCFS database doesn't have the best search engine ever, but we can automatically confirm on our end that the CCFS entry is equivalent to the tax parcel owner name. \n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, regex string matching can only do so much for us. Sometimes, we need a human in the loop to identify if a search result in the CCFS database really does match up with the tax parcel owner. That's why when running `lookup_helper.get_company_matches_and_export`, there are three output files: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `Exact_matches_i.csv`: results where search term matches a result in CCFS database.  \n",
    "- `Potential_matches_i.csv`: when search term doesn't exactly match, there needs to be some human verification here to determine.  \n",
    "- `Additional_matches_i.csv`: very weak matches in case potential_matches didn't yield enough results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Where `i` is the batch number. Looking up entries in the CCFS database can be time-consuming, so splitting up your tax parcel owner names into batches might be helpful. \n",
    "\n",
    "These output files will have a mapping from the tax parcel owner, which is referred to as the `SearchTerm`, to the equivalent CCFS entry, indicated with `BusinessName`. A human will need to go into the `potential_matches_i.csv` and add the column `is_match` to flag if the search term and the business name are likely to be equivalent. An example of this is that `SATO FAMILY LTD PARTNERSHIP` (the search term, ie. the tax parcel owner name) and `SATO FAMILY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP` (the result in the CCFS database) are highly likely to be the same companies.
